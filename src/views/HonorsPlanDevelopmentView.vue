            experience with working in teams where communication is required, I feel that I personally could still work
            on my understanding and non-verbal communication skills.

    <h1>SMART Goals</h1>
    <div class="smart-goal">
      <h2>Goal: Learn the Rust Programming Language</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Specifics:</b>
        Learn the Rust Programming Language by reading The Book, and make three small terminal tools to demonstrate my
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Measurable:</b>
        My completion of the three projects is clear and measurable. Additionally, though, I hope to be able to explain
        any Rust code that I read online in an open source project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Achievable:</b>
        I have a good amount of experience with C++ and Python, and I feel that I can learn Rust in a reasonable amount
        of time. I am also very interested in the language and have been wanting to learn it for a while, so I believe I
        should definitely be able to complete this goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Relevant:</b>
        Rust is a language that is becoming more and more popular, and I believe that it would be a good addition to my
        skillset. I have heard many great things about the language, and I feel that adding it to my software arsenal
        could be fantastic for the future projects I will develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Time-bound:</b>
        I will complete this goal by the end of February. At the time of writing this, it is the beginning of November,
        so I have a good amount of time to complete this goal.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="smart-goal">
      <h2>Goal: Introduce Myself to All of My Professors</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Specifics:</b>
        I will personally introduce myself to each of the professors that I have this semester to build rapport and
        connections for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Measurable:</b>
        I will keep track of my professors and I will ensure that I speak with each of them directly. If I am unable to
        speak with them in person, I will send them an email.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Achievable:</b>
        I will be able to dedicate time in between my classes to go to their office hours and introduce myself. While
        this may require some care, I'm certain I'll be able to complete this goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Relevant:</b>
        Building good relationships with my professors will be very important for my time in their class, as well as for
        the rest of my time in the College of Engineering. This is especially important as I look for a faculty advisor
        to oversee my Honors Capstone Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Time-bound:</b>
        As the semester ends in six weeks (at the time of writing this), I will need to complete this goal by then. By
        fixing the time frame to this semester itself, I will be able to keep the conversation relevant and productive.
