They had just purchased a very large video display at the Fr. Richard Elmer Stadium, and wanted some custom software to display the scores of the games. I realized this potential and how it could work with the media team who broadcasts games at home, and created this special software to enable them to display both simultaneously. </p><h2 data-v-1b1b7d3d>My Part</h2><p data-v-1b1b7d3d> I began developing the software independently from scratch, and decided to engineer a special system that would allow a theoretically infinite number of scoreboards or broadcasts to connect, each displaying unique graphics. I further recognized the potential for this system to connect directly with the existing scoreboard control panel that the announcers had been familiar with and using for years, and I was able to link this into the program. I worked with the media directors to develop graphics, and added colorful and fun animations to bring the scoreboard to life. </p><p data-v-1b1b7d3d> The software is still in use today years later, and has been continuing to work perfectly. I&#39;ve received several complements from the media team and the athletic department on how well the software has worked, as well as from fans and viewers at home who say that the technology greatly helps them to connect to the events. I&#39;m very proud of the work I did on this project, and I&#39;m excited to continue to see it when I tune in to broadcasts or attend the games. </p><br data-v-1b1b7d3d><p data-v-1b1b7d3d>Read this article to see more about how my scoreboard software was integral to the media team:</p><a href="https://www.catholiccentral.net/news/latest-news/~board/news/post/faculty-spotlight-jennifer-teed-mentors-media-students" data-v-1b1b7d3d> Read Article </a><h2 data-v-1b1b7d3d>Engineering Competencies</h2><p data-v-1b1b7d3d> This project gave me great experience with <b data-v-1b1b7d3d>systems thinking</b> as I was required to design this software from the ground up. I had to make several critical decisions about how this software would integrate into the existing workflow that the media team had been used to, and I had to engineer it such that it would be easy to work with for years to come. Working on this gave me so much practical experience with making tools that other users will interact with, and helped me to understand how to work within client constraints and goals. </p><h2 data-v-1b1b7d3d>The Result</h2><p data-v-1b1b7d3d> At the opening game of the season, my scoreboard technology was debuted to thousands of excited fans, with great success.
