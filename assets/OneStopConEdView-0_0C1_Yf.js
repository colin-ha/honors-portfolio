To keep their license, realtors must complete a certain amount of coursework every year. This website allows the agents to purchase courses, take a quiz, and be certified with the state. </p><h2 data-v-e2be1977>My Part</h2><p data-v-e2be1977> The owners of this company reached out to me, and asked if I could develop a new website for them. Originally, they had used Weebly, and found it to be unreliable and dated. I worked to build a new website from the ground up, with all of their design constraints in mind. Additionally, they had a very large existing customer base. This meant that I had to ensure that the transition from the old website to the new one was seamless, and consistent. </p><p data-v-e2be1977> Throughout my work on this website, I was constantly iterating the development. I was able to establish the following development cycle: </p><ol data-v-e2be1977><li data-v-e2be1977>The client asked for features and pages of content.</li><li data-v-e2be1977>I would respond in turn by clarifying extra details and making suggestions.</li><li data-v-e2be1977>I developed this set of content, testing thoroughly as I went.</li><li data-v-e2be1977>I sent test environments to the client, they responded with more feedback, and the cycle continued.</li></ol><h2 data-v-e2be1977>Engineering Competencies</h2><p data-v-e2be1977> This project gave me great experience with <b data-v-e2be1977>systems thinking</b> . Since the existing website needed to be essentially completely scrapped, I had to design a new system from nothing. I spent quite some time researching the technologies and frameworks that I felt would be best for this project. Sometimes, this would change as the project went on and the requirements shifted. <b data-v-e2be1977>Communicating</b> with the client during this process was crucial, and I learned a lot about how to manage client expectations, as well as to suggest features for the client that would benefit them greatly. </p><h2 data-v-e2be1977>The Result</h2><p data-v-e2be1977> After many months of work, the project was finally completed. After lots of preparation, the transition process went very smoothly, and I was able to get the website up and running with minimal downtime. The client was very happy with the result, and I was able to provide them with a website that was far more reliable and user-friendly than their previous one. Additionally, we were able to launch several new features that the old website did not have, including an online quiz taking option, a full administrative console for direct control, and some technology to allow the client to edit the website themselves when needed. Looking back, I&#39;m incredibly proud of the work I did on this project, and I&#39;m glad that I was able to provide a great service to the client. </p>",11))])]))}}),_=p(y,[["__scopeId","data-v-e2be1977"]]);export{_ as default};
