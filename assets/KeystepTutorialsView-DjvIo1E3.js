The channel has almost 5,000 videos and covers a wide variety of songs. I&#39;ve written a Java program that automates the creation of these videos, and I&#39;ve integrated a system to help me manage the channel and its content. </p><h2 data-v-f92dc886>My Part</h2><p data-v-f92dc886> I came up with this idea from two main inspirations. First, I wanted to create tutorials for songs that were less well-known, so that everyone could learn piano with the songs they love, regardless of popularity. I play the piano myself, and have found these videos to be a great way to learn new songs. Second, I had already attempted an automated channel, which made slowed down remixes of popular songs. I noticed that every upload on this other channel was ineligible to monetize, since I was using copyrighted material. I decided to pivot towards transformative content, which I could monetize, and that&#39;s how KeyStep Tutorials was born. </p><p data-v-f92dc886> I had several pieces of this project which I needed to tie together. First, I had to find an available source of data for the songs. I found some websites which made their music available for download, and that would apply as transformative content for copyright purposes. I wrote technology to gather the information from these websites, and put them into a database I maintained. I then worked to develop a Java program that would take this data and create a video for each song. I also had to write a system to manage the channel, and to upload the videos automatically. To tie these together, I wrote a user interface that would allow me to control the system. </p><h2 data-v-f92dc886>Engineering Competencies</h2><p data-v-f92dc886> This project gave me great experience with having an <b data-v-f92dc886>entreprenurial mindset</b> . In June of 2022, I received reached the goal of 1,000 subscribers, and shortly after applying, I received word that I was approved into the YouTube Partner Program. I then began to focus on expanding the channel so that I could continue to profit from my work. I worked on developing the community, upgrading the quality of the content, and I have now expanded my plans to include future opportunities for new types of music. I&#39;ve done data analysis and research into the analytics I receive from YouTube, and I&#39;ve used this information to continue to develop my business and grow its reach. </p><img alt="A screenshot of some nice notifications" src="'+f+'" class="article-left" data-v-f92dc886><h2 data-v-f92dc886>The Result</h2><p data-v-f92dc886> Since the channel launched, I&#39;ve seen tremendous success. I have over 20,000 hours of watch time, and several long time viewers. Every day, I receive many wonderful comments like the ones shown here. These are from people who have learned to play the piano from my videos, and who are very appreciative of the tutorials I&#39;ve created. I have also received many requests for songs, and I&#39;ve been able to fulfill many of these requests. It makes me so happy to see how much people enjoy my work, and I&#39;m excited to continue to grow the channel and expand it to new levels. </p>',11))])]))}}),S=c(b,[["__scopeId","data-v-f92dc886"]]);export{S as default};
