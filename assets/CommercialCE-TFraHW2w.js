To keep their license, realtors must complete a certain amount of coursework every year. This website allows the agents to purchase video-based courses, take a quiz, and be certified with the state. </p><h2 data-v-b4b1802c>My Part</h2><p data-v-b4b1802c> The owners of this company already had an existing platform developed for them years prior, named 123 Con Ed. They had just entered into a new business opportunity in which they wanted to produce commercial-focused real estate content in partnership with a leading video educator. They decided that they wanted to brand this differently from their existing website and would require new features and content accordingly. </p><p data-v-b4b1802c> I inherited this old codebase and began to learn and understand it. I realized that the existing website was built on a stack that I wasn&#39;t very familiar with, so I began researching and learning about the technologies that I would need to use. Once I was very well-versed in the codebase, I began making the graphical changes they had requested, and further added support for videos in the courses, and behind-the-scenes payment splitting for royalties to the course creators. This entire process was a very iterative design cycle where I was constantly incorporating feedback from the client and making changes as needed. </p><p data-v-b4b1802c>The website is soon to launch officially, but is still visible now in its test state.</p><h2 data-v-b4b1802c>Engineering Competencies</h2><p data-v-b4b1802c> This project gave me great experience with <b data-v-b4b1802c>systems thinking</b> . It took a lot of effort to understand this existing codebase and how I would be able to work with it going forward, but I learned a lot about working with code that others had produced, and how to make changes to it. <b data-v-b4b1802c>Creativity</b> was also a must, as I had to come up with new ways to display the content and make the website more user-friendly and engaging for this new form of content. </p><h2 data-v-b4b1802c>The Result</h2><p data-v-b4b1802c> I&#39;m incredibly happy with my work so far, but unfortunately the website has not officially launched as the terms of the deal are being negotiated. I&#39;m excited to see the website go live and to see how the users interact with the new content and features that I&#39;ve added, and I&#39;ll keep you posted as the website goes live. </p>",11))])]))}}),_=h(y,[["__scopeId","data-v-b4b1802c"]]);export{_ as default};
